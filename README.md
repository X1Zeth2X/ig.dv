## Assets

The following SVG assets were from [unDraw](https://undraw.co/).
I may not need to credit them but their resources are really good.

## TODO

- Media collection reader.
- Use Vue Mixins to reduce code redundancy.
- Implement Unit Tests.
- Smart tools (Future features).
  - Find out what you were doing at a certain time (activity tracking).
  - Check where you were when doing these activities.
  - Location & Activity filtering.

The setup is pretty similar to those of Vue-cli projects.
